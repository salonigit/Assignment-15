Loops--
The JavaScript loops are used to iterate the piece of code using for, while, do while or for-in loops. It makes the code compact. It is mostly used in array.
There are 3 types of loops in JavaScript.
1
1) JavaScript For loop
The JavaScript for loop iterates the elements for the fixed number of times. It should be used if number of iteration is known. The syntax of for loop is given below.
for (initialization; condition; increment)  
{  
    code to be executed  
}  

2) JavaScript while loop
The JavaScript while loop iterates the elements for the infinite number of times. It should be used if number of iteration is not known. The syntax of while loop is given below.
while (condition)  
{  
    code to be executed  
}  

3) JavaScript do while loop
The JavaScript do while loop iterates the elements for the infinite number of times like while loop. But, code is executed at least once whether condition is true or false. The syntax of do while loop is given below.
do{  
    code to be executed  
}while (condition);  

JavaScript Functions--
JavaScript functions are used to perform operations. We can call JavaScript function many times to reuse the code.

There are mainly two advantages of JavaScript functions.

Code reusability: We can call a function several times so it save coding.
Less coding: It makes our program compact. We donâ€™t need to write many lines of code each time to perform a common task.

The syntax of declaring function is given below.

function functionName([arg1, arg2, ...argN]){  
 //code to be executed  
}  
JavaScript Functions can have 0 or more arguments.

JavaScript Objects--
A javaScript object is an entity having state and behavior (properties and method). For example: car, pen, bike, chair, glass, keyboard, monitor etc.

JavaScript is an object-based language. Everything is an object in JavaScript.

JavaScript is template based not class based. Here, we don't create class to get the object. But, we direct create objects.

There are 3 ways to create objects.

1. By object literal
2. By creating instance of Object directly (using new keyword)
3. By using an object constructor (using new keyword)

JavaScript Operators--
JavaScript operators are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands. For example:

There are following types of operators in JavaScript.

1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Comparison (Relational) Operators
3. Bitwise Operators
4. Logical Operators
5. Assignment Operators
6. Special Operators

JavaScript Array--
JavaScript array is an object that represents a collection of similar type of elements.

There are 3 ways to construct array in JavaScript

1) JavaScript array literal
The syntax of creating array using array literal is given below:
var arrayname=[value1,value2.....valueN];  

2) JavaScript Array directly (new keyword)
The syntax of creating array directly is given below:

var arrayname=new Array();  
Here, new keyword is used to create instance of array.

3) JavaScript array constructor (new keyword)
Here, you need to create instance of array by passing arguments in constructor so that we don't have to provide value explicitly.

The example of creating object by array constructor is given below.

<script>  
var emp=new Array("Jai","Vijay","Smith");  
for (i=0;i<emp.length;i++){  
document.write(emp[i] + "<br>");  
}  
</script>

What is sequelizer?
Sequelize is a promise-based, Node.js ORM (Object-relational mapping) for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. It features solid transaction support, relations, eager and lazy loading, read replication, and more.
A great thing about Sequelize is that it does not care about your underlying database. You can easily switch databases by adjusting the configuration file, and your code will mostly remain the same.
